      "contents": "\n\nThe site is a window into work at Stanford Libraries to build capacity\nin AI while experimenting with applications of AI on library materials\nand in library processes. We approach building capacity as a\ncross-library effort. While an essential part of the effort is giving\ndevelopers an opportunity to get their hands on new tools and understand\nnew ways of working, it is also an effort to familiarize people from all\nparts of the library with the potential of AI so that they can identify\nuseful applications of the technology, help shape the projects, assess\noutcomes (at every step) and bring domain expertise to the challenges\nthat arise.\n\n\nThe Stanford Libraries Steering Group formed in 2020 to shape and guide\nthe effort. The group produced a document,\nStanford\nLibraries AI Guiding Values, to explicitly address the ways we think\nthe ethos of the library needs to be reflected in the ways we use this\ntechnology.\n\n\nCURRENT - ACTIVE\n\n\nSPOC (Species Occurrences)\n\n\nProject\nBook - Data, models, and documentation of the project\n\n\nGithub\nRepository - Code repository and project communications\n\n\nObservations of marine plants and animals are “hidden” in the text of\nundergraduate student research papers (Paper > TIFF > OCR >\nplain text). These historical observations are important historical\nmarkers for studies of biodiversity and the effects of climate change on\nspecies. The goal of this project is to extract species occurrences\n(genus-species, place, time) from student papers held in libraries along\nthe western coast of the U.S., verify those observations, and contribute\nthem to the\nGlobal\nBiodiversity Information Facilty (GBIF).\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS PROJECTS\n\n\n\nElectronic Theses and Dissertations\n\n\nThis project was our first dive into how machine learning and natural\nlanguage processing might help us automate the assignment of subject\nheadings from the\nFAST\n(Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) vocabulary to ETDs.\n\n\nObjective: To become familiar with the data, experiment\nwith methods, and determine whether we can successfully automate or\nsemi-automate FAST subject headings for ETDs.\n\n\nOutcomes:\n\n\n\ndruid_2_text\n(to retrieve pdf from our repository and convert to txt for\npre-processing)\n\n\n\n\nDocument\nStructure Classifier (to extract bibliographies)\n\n\n\n\nBiology\nETDs FAST tagging app\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nSimilarity/clustering app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
